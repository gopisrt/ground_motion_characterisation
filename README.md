# ground_motion_characterisation

read_PEER_NGA_file.py reads the PEER NGA ground motion file and outputs time series (ground acceleration, velocity or displacement)

Next, ground_motion_processing.py performs the processing through 1) bandpass butterworth filter, 2) de-mean, and 3) cosine tapering.
